            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <!--<p>My name is Zubenathi Lande. Welcome to my personal webpage where you can learn more about me, my projects, and get in touch. I am passionate about CODING, DJing and my interest in electronics.</p>-->
            <p>I am a dedicated student and recent graduate with a passion for continuous learning and exploring new opportunities. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in IT(Information Technology and System), equipping me with the skills to adapt and thrive in a dynamic environment. <br> <br>

            I am the firstborn child in my family, and my role has shaped my character and ambitions significantly. Growing up, I have always felt a strong sense of responsibility to set a positive example for my siblings while cherishing the values instilled in me by my mother and grandparents. My family has been my anchor, providing unwavering support and encouragement throughout my journey. They have nurtured my passion for education and creativity, teaching me the importance of hard work and perseverance. The love and guidance from my family inspire me to strive for excellence in all areas of my life. <br> <br>
                
                Balancing both academic and personal interests, I strive to excel in all that I do, whether itâ€™s in the classroom, at work, or behind the decks. I believe that learning never stops, and I am always looking for new ways to grow and develop as a professional.</p>
